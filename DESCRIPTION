Description: This packages is an addin for RStudio that will count the words
    and characters in a plain text document. It is designed for use with R markdown
    documents and will exclude YAML header content, code chunks and inline code from
    the counts. It also computes readability statistics so you can get an idea of
    how easy or difficult your text is to read.
